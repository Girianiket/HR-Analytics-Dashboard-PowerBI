The analysis shows that the company has a high attrition rate of 16.1%, with the majority of employees leaving between the ages of 26 and 35. Most of the attrition occurs among employees earning below 5K, indicating that salary is a major factor influencing turnover. Employees from Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds have the highest attrition percentage, while Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians are the roles most affected. Additionally, attrition is highest within the first two years of employment, suggesting a need for better onboarding and engagement strategies.

Implementing these measures will help improve employee performance, enhance job satisfaction, and significantly reduce overall attrition rates.
